### Why?

Sometimes MetaMask wallet on Firefox won't load due to incorrect file name, so I created this simple program to fix it.

A simple GUI tool for viewing and copying ID values from MetaMask SQLite databases. This tool helps users identify and manage MetaMask wallet files by comparing database IDs with wallet folder names.

The ID number shown by this tool is the MetaMask file identifier that the SQL database is looking for.
What to do if numbers don't match? Copy the ID using COPY button and rename your file.

## 📋 What This Tool Does

**MetaMask ID Viewer** helps you manage MetaMask wallet files by:

1. **🔍 Scanning** your directory for SQLite databases with 'file' tables
2. **📊 Displaying** ID numbers from MetaMask databases in a user-friendly interface
3. **📋 Copying** ID values to clipboard with one click
4. **🔗 Matching** database IDs with MetaMask folder names to identify mismatches

### Why Use This Tool?

When MetaMask wallet folder names don't match their internal database IDs, wallets may not start properly. This tool helps you:
- **Identify** the correct ID for each wallet
- **Compare** database IDs with folder names
- **Copy** the correct ID to rename folders manually
- **Fix** wallet startup issues

## 🖥️ How to Use

### Step 1: Launch the Application
Run the script in your MetaMask data directory or any folder containing MetaMask databases.

### Step 2: Automatic Scanning
The tool automatically scans the current directory for SQLite databases containing a 'file' table.

### Step 3: View Database IDs
- Found databases appear in the "Found databases" section
- ID values are displayed in a scrollable list with RefCount information
- Each ID has a green "COPY" button

### Step 4: Copy and Rename
1. **Compare** the displayed ID with your MetaMask folder name
2. **Click "COPY"** next to the correct ID
3. **Rename** your MetaMask folder to match the copied ID
